Create an ini�aliza�on method that creates 5-8 accounts and fills them with money. You can
read this from a file or hardcode the informa�on.
• Create a while loop with the following menu op�ons:
o Ask for the account ID (You will need to output these somewhere so when I test your
code, I know what to try)
 Make a deposit.
 Make a withdrawal.
 Check the balance.
 Ask if they would like another op�on or log out of their account.
o Ask if the user would like to check another account.
o Ask if the user would like to create a new account.
o DO NOT create an infinite loop. Use logic and create keywords that will cause your loop
to exit.
• Create another while loop (or add it to the above while loop) that runs the specifica�on
tests.
• End of program
